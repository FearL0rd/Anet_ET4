## Hello world!

This is a working, but not optimized code. For now it acts as my backup.

## dev

I'm currently working on the 2nd branch (dev) and will merge everything in the main, once I feel it's stable enough.
Feel free to try the dev branch and leave a review, comment or whatever :)

## Installation

To install the configuration files, simply run the following command in your raspberry pi terminal:

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KarlAvec1K/Anet_ET4/main/install.sh)
