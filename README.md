Works as is, but knowing myself, it is still a work in progress as I'm always trying to optimize my printer!
I'm still working on making the original Anet ET4 display work. I will update when it does.

## Installation

To install the configuration files, simply run the following command in your raspberry pi terminal:

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KarlAvec1K/Anet_ET4/main/install.sh)
